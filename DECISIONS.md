# Implementation decisions log

Decisions made at implementation time (2026-07-04) that refine or deviate
from the founding spec, with the evidence that forced them. Read this
before "fixing" any of these back.

## D-IMPL-1 — Transit-role eyeballs stay `:residential_isp`; only `tier1_transit` is ambiguous

**The problem.** The founding spec's precedence had `category==isp AND
role∈{tier1,major,midsize}_transit → :unknown` ("ISP+transit ambiguity"),
while its own acceptance panel required Telefónica ES → `:residential_isp`.
Live ipverse data (2026-07-04) breaks the tie: ipverse assigns networkRole
by routing-graph position, so essentially EVERY national consumer telco
carries a transit role — Comcast/Telefónica/Vodafone DE/Orange/BT/TIM are
`major_transit`; AT&T/Verizon/DT are `tier1_transit`. Measured impact of
the rule as originally written: **40.2% of routed IPv4 space would classify
`:unknown`** (isp+tier1 6.6% + isp+major 24.7% + isp+midsize 8.9%),
including virtually all of Europe's and North America's home users. That
contradicts the panel, the validated prototype behavior, and the product's
first-boot usefulness requirement.

**The resolution.**
- `category==isp` + any role except `tier1_transit` → `:residential_isp`.
- `category==isp` + `tier1_transit` → `:unknown` (rule `isp_transit_ambiguous`).
- The tier1 set is tiny and hand-reviewable: **19 ASNs worldwide**
  (measured 2026-07-04). Exactly four are consumer-heavy — AT&T AS7018
  (89M IPs), Verizon AS701 (41M), Deutsche Telekom AS3320 (34M), Liberty
  Global AS6830 — and are confirmed as eyeballs in
  `data/overrides/eyeball_confirm.txt`. The rest (Lumen AS3356, Cogent
  AS174, GTT AS3257, NTT AS2914, Zayo AS6461, PCCW AS3491, Tata AS6453,
  Arelion AS1299, Orange OpenTransit AS5511, Sparkle AS6762, Telefónica
  Global AS12956, two IXPs, …) are genuine backbone space and stay
  honestly `:unknown` (~60M IPs).

**Why this is the right trade.** International backbone arms are usually
separate ASNs from consumer arms (AS5511 vs AS3215; AS6762 vs AS3269;
AS12956 vs AS3352), so ASN granularity already encodes the distinction —
except for the four confirmed giants. Sophisticated consumers can still
read `network_role` from the result and apply their own transit policy.

## D-IMPL-2 — Panel row 81.9.5.10 expects `:business` (was `:unknown`)

The founding panel expected `:unknown` based on the February-2026
prototype, whose simplified classifier had no `:business` verdict (its
`:other` bucket was relabeled). Live data: 81.9.5.10 belongs to AS20597
(PJSC Vimpelcom), which ipverse now categorizes `business`/`stub` — the
production precedence correctly yields `:business` via the category rule.
Updated in `spotchecks.yml` with a history note.

## D-IMPL-3 — License pins target what actually declares the license

Planned pins assumed each upstream has a LICENSE file. Reality
(2026-07-04): sapics/ip-location-db has none — the PDDL declaration for
origin-asn lives in `origin-asn/SOURCES.md` (pinned whole). X4BNet has none
— MIT lives in README.md under "# License" including the load-bearing
"source files **and generated output**" sentence; we pin that extracted
section only, so unrelated README churn can't trip the gate but any edit
to the grant does (`pipeline/lib/license_gate.rb`).

## D-IMPL-4 — `mobile_carrier.txt` seeds dedicated-mobile ASNs only

Keyword sweeps surface converged telcos (fixed+mobile on one ASN: KDDI,
SoftBank, SFR, Vodafone national ASNs…) and fixed-wireless WISPs. Both are
deliberately excluded: converged ASNs stay `:residential_isp` (equally
likely_human — a miss costs nothing), and WISP subscribers are homes, not
carrier NAT. The seed carries only unambiguous cellular networks; recall
grows via PRs under the same rule.
